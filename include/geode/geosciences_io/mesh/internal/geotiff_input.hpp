            // profiles (.icc or .icm) to ensure color consistency across
            // different devices.
            //* Layered or Multi-Page TIFFs: Some TIFF files store multiple
            // images (e.g., multi-page scans). In such cases, associated files
            // might be used to store extracted or processed versions of
            // individual pages.

            // additional files such as .tfw (world file) or .prj may provide
            // spatial reference data.

            // without opening large TIFF files.
